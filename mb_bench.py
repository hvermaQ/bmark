#many body benchmark
#for systems with ground state energies known in the thermodynamic limit
# typically we need cases where the energy converges to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit
# random seeds yeild the error bars at individual points
#structure: MB_benchmark class.
#inputs: nqbits, nshots, noise param, rnds
#selections: Anstaz, topology, compression, 2x hardwares, gateset 
#next version: noise type,
